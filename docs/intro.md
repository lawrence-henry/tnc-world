# TNC World

A compact, narrative-focused tabletop roleplaying game about exploration, conflict, and small groups forced to make hard choices in a changing world.

## Overview
TNC World is a rules-light system that centers on character motives, player-driven scenes, and fast resolution. Emphasis is on story beats and consequences rather than simulation: tense choices, risky plans, and the social costs of survival.

## What you need
- 1 Gamemaster (GM) and 2–6 players  
- 1–2 six-sided dice (d6) per player (or a dice pool app)  
- Character sheets (one per player)  
- Tokens or markers for resource tracking  

## Core themes
- Survival vs. Ethics: tradeoffs between doing what's needed and who you become doing it  
- Small-group dynamics: leadership, trust, and betrayal under pressure  
- Mystery of the world: fragments to discover, consequences to unwrap

## How to play (quick)
1. Create characters: pick a role, a driving desire, and one secret.  
2. The GM frames a scene and prompts player actions.  
3. Players declare an action and roll d6 (simple success/failure or use a small pool).  
4. GM describes results and advances threats or rewards.  
5. Track resources and complications; use short downtime between scenes to develop characters.

## Safety and session zero
- Run a short session zero to set tone, boundaries, and consent.  
- Use safety tools (X-card, lines & veils) and establish hard limits.  
- Agree on the level of violence, horror, and mature themes beforehand.

## For the GM
- Start small: one clear objective and one strong antagonist.  
- Keep scenes short and move the spotlight between players.  
- Use complications to force meaningful choices rather than arbitrary penalties.

## Next steps
- Read the rules reference for character generation, mechanics, and combat.  
- Try a one-shot scenario to learn pacing and flow.  
- Share feedback and house rules with your table.
